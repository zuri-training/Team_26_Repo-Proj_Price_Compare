      <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
      <p>In order to give you the world’s best price and product comparison service, we need to store small amounts of data on your device. In our cookie policy, we explain which technologies we use, and what we use them for</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Introduction</li>
          <p>This cookie policy applies to the use of local storage of data and other similar technologies that take place within the framework of ScoutVendor, that is, when you use the service ScoutVendor and in related digital applications ("the Services"). The service is provided by ScoutVendor Net, ("ScoutVendor", "we" or "us")</p>
          <li>What is meant by local storage of data, cookies and similar technology?</li>
          <p>Local storage of data means that data is stored locally on your device (for example on a computer, mobile phone or tablet) via your browser. Local storage of data may, for example, include your user settings, information on how you have used the Services, which browser you use, which advertisements have been shown to you, and how you have interacted on the web pages that we cooperate with.</p>
          <p>One type of local storage of data is cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device and allows us to recognise your browser. Cookies do not contain any direct identifiers such as name, address, phone number, or social security number. Information stored in cookies needs to be combined with additional information for us to be able to identify users.</p>
          <p>We also use other similar technologies such as web beacons and pixel tags. These techniques can recognise cookies and identifiers so that third parties can place cookies on your device.</p>
          <p>In this document the term "local storage of data" is used as a collective term for cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and other similar technology.</p>
          <li>Why do we use local storage of data on our websites?</li>
          <p>We use local storage of data for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>to provide the basic functions of the Services.</li>
              <li>to analyse and improve the Services.</li>
              <li>to personalise our Services, including advertising.</li>
              <li>to target ads and to create target groups for marketing purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A more detailed explanation of the purposes follows below:</p>
          <ol className='nested_ol'>
              <li>Provision of the basic functions of the Services.</li>
              <p>In order for us to be able to offer the basic functions of the Services, we need to use local storage of data. Such functions include, among other things, saving of what choices our users have made, adapting the Services according to the user's technical conditions, and storing which searches a user previously has made.</p>
              <li>Analysing and improving the Services.</li>
              <p>We collect information about the traffic to and on the Services by using local storage of data. In this way, we can recognise browsers, collect statistics on the use of the Services, and understand which parts of the Services are most interesting for our users. We transform this information into statistics in order to analyse them with the aim of improving ScoutVendor, but also other services provided by our partners.</p>
              <li>Personalising our Services, including advertising.</li>
              <p>In order to adapt the content of the Services according to what our users are interested in, we use local storage of data. In this way, we can remember which products you have looked at and make qualified assessments of what you might be interested in.</p>
              <p>This purpose also includes our and our partners’ use of local storage of data on the Services, in order to personalise ads. Through this use of local storage of data, we can get information about how often you have seen an ad, how much time that has passed since you saw the ad, and how you acted after you saw it. The locally stored data helps us build segments and target groups in order for us to target our and our partners’ advertising in an optimal way.</p>
              <li>Creating target ads andgroups for marketing purposes.</li>
              <p>We allow carefully selected third parties to use local storage of data on our users' devices for the purpose of targeting ads and creating target groups so that we and our partners can target ads and marketing to our users. The use of local storage of data for this purpose increases the possibility for you to get relevant marketing online. It happens that the third parties who place cookies on our users' devices are also able to gather personal data. You can read more about this in our privacy policy.</p>
          </ol>
          <li>Who else uses local storage of data on our websites?</li>
          <p>We allow carefully selected partners to use local storage of data on the Services. In cases where third parties also take part of personal data for which we are personal data controllers, we enter into special agreements with them so that this takes place in accordance with applicable legislation. You can read more about our and our partners' processing of personal data in our privacy policy.</p>
          <li>How can I manage locally stored data?</li>
          <p>You can either adjust the settings in your web browser or use special programs that have been developed to manage cookies. The settings in your web browser normally show a list of all the cookies that have been stored to provide you with an overview and, if you wish, to delete unwanted cookies. Normally you can indicate that you accept storage of cookies from websites you visit or from third parties affiliated to those websites. You can also choose to be notified every time a new cookie is stored. Guidance on how to do this in different web browsers is provided below. Your web browser normally stores cookies in a specific folder on your hard disk, so you can also examine the contents in more detail</p>
          <p>We have also prepared a list of the main forms of local storage of data that are present on our website and more details about their purpose. The list is available below. However, the cookies that are present on the website change frequently, and not all cookies are equally important. We will therefore update the list of which cookies are available regularly.</p>
